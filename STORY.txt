We open with Karla sitting in her room.
It's late. Around 1 am.
~Why is she up this late?
~~She's been down lately.
~~Her recent nights have been spent
~~up in her bed thinking about. . .
~~~Thinking about what?
~~~~The reason that she's been down.
~~~~~What made her feel down?
~~~~~~The death of her mother
~~~~~~~What happened to her mother?
~~~~~~~~TODO

She sits up talking to her digital
journal. She's blind. On her desk
are a handful of external hard
drives presumably holding gigabytes
of audio journals. She's talking
to her mother,

"Why couldn't it have
been me? I never even got to tell you
goodbye. I could have been a better
daughter. I just want you to be here.
I want you to tell me goodnight. I miss you. . .
It's not fair; I hate him. He didn't learn
his lesson!"
~Who's he?
~~Her father

She's crying

She stops the recording with a click.
Her sleeve falls revealing a tattoo on
her wrist: a single, ornately drawn
eye.
~Why the tattoo?
~~The tattoo signified her acceptance
~~of her disability that she once
~~struggled to deal with/accept.
~~~She's accepted it and moved on.

She turns out the light in her room and
cries softly into her pillow. Under her
pillow is her hand clutching a silver
necklace.
~Who's necklace?
~~It was her mother's necklace.
~~She gave it to her two weeks
~~before she passed.
~~~Why did her mother give her
~~~the necklace?


The room down the hall, the living room: In it her father is sitting alone on the couch.
His head hanging in his hands. He's overwhelmed. He picks up the drink from the coffee
table, a glass of neat whiskey. He feels as though the only way that he could possibly
cope with the loss of his wife is in a bottle. He can't bear the responsibility for the
death of his wife. He was drunk when his wife called around 11pm wanting a ride home from
work because she felt too tired to drive. She quickly realized that she would, in fact, be
driving herself home. On the way home, she dozed off. The vehicle veered off of the road
and collided head on with a matured oak tree. She was dead on impact. He can't handle the
fact that, had he been sober enough to drive her home, she would still be in his and his
daughter's life. He is also worried about his relationship with his daughter, Karla. She
has yet to forgive him. 

He wants to save his relationship with his daughter.

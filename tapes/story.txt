Karla,
I'm probably dead by the time you're listening to this.
I probably should have told you sooner, but the idea
that I would soon be shaking hands with Death is hard
to live it. It made me cold and calloused.

Karla,
I guess this is how you feel, huh? It's peaceful, really.
What does the world look like to you? How do you contain
your imagination? It's different, though. Being blind at
birth isn't the same as going blind after years of sight.
It makes me appreciate the vibrant colors that pass me by
every day.

"Why would you do that? How could you? I realize that it's
not your fault that she can't see, but to tell her that
her only friends aren't real. You're heartless. Do you
know what it's like to be alone? You wouldn't last a day
in her shoes. It should have been you!"


"She was a good wife and a better mother."


"Hey, Karla? How are you?"


"I wonder if she has super-hearing because she's blind."


"I bet she runs into walls like all the time."


"Why do I deserve to have to babysit her? She can't do
anything!"


"Honey, what do you want to eat? We need to be there in
thirty minutes, so pick someth . . ."


"The need to know is unbearable. Am I talking to myself?
Am I hearing the voices of those around me or am I
hearing the voice within me. Both? Which are real?
Which are imaginary?"
